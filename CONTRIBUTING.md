## Getting started

### Issues

#### Creating new issues

If you spot a problem, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. When you start working on an issue move it to `In Progress` and assign it to yourself.
