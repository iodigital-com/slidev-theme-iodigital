# Stylesheets

Styles should mostly be defined in a `<style scoped>` element in a `.vue` component file. Only those which apply to multiple/all layouts and components should go here. New style sheets can be created to encapsulate various parts of the theme.

***IN ANY CASE*** make sure to `import` any CSS file in this folder in the `index.ts` file.
